The best way to break the monotony of our life and learn a lot about different places and cultures in the world is travelling. I think that our modern life is impossible without travelling. People get tired of their daily routine, they need to change the surroundings. So they go to a travel agency, buy tickets to some nice place, pack their suitcases and set off on a journey.
Travelling has a great educational value because it is a chance to meet new people, visit museums and ancient sights, discover different ways of life, taste national cuisines and practice foreign languages. It makes us more appreciative of other cultures. The best way to study geography is to go to distant countries and cities.
We can travel by different means of transport: by plane, by ship, by train, by car and even on foot. It depends on our plans and preferences. Plane is the fastest but the most expensive means of transport. Travelling in a modern train can be very comfortable and enjoyable. We can admire picturesque landscapes from the window and communicate with our companions. When we travel by car we don’t have to buy any tickets or book a hotel, we can stop wherever we want and stay there as long as we like. Travelling on foot (or hiking) is quite popular among young people. It’s really exciting to walk in the countryside enjoying the beauty of hills and valleys, lakes and forests.
My parents spend their holidays travelling too. I was only 4 years old when they first took me to Turkey. That was an unforgettable holiday by the sea. We swam and sunbathed, went sailing and fishing. And we took plenty of beautiful pictures there.
Travelling is great! It can give you a great deal of pleasant emotions and memories. It’s the time for relaxation and thinking. People often return home with a fresh outlook on life and a fantastic zeal to do something good. And they usually say: “East or West – home is best.”
