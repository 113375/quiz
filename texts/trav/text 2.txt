Travelling is one of the best activities a person can do. When you travel you get new experience, learn about the cultures of other countries and visit unique places around the whole world. Travelling is learning foreign languages, tasting local dishes and meeting new friends.
My family and I travel quite a lot, we have already visited many places in Russia and abroad. But still I have a dream about a perfect holiday I will have some day.
I like beach holiday but at the same time I can’t stay at one place for a long time. So usually when we go travelling we try to combine sightseeing and relaxing on the seaside. So my dream holiday is not an exception. I would like to go to luxurious five star hotel with delicious food and no Russian people around. There should certainly be a swimming pool and it should be close to the sea. I like when there are young people in the hotel, because then it usually has parties every night, where you can dance and meet interesting people.
My perfect holiday should last for about 2 weeks – one week of relaxing on the beach and another one is for excursions and sightseeing. I am fond of watching ruins of ancient buildings, wonderful architecture of European cities. So if I had a holiday of my dream I would certainly go to Spain or Italy, where I would have a chance to combine sea and excursions. I would get up early to have time for every interesting place and activities.
My dream holiday also includes meeting new people. When I travel I always try to find new friends from different countries and then to stay in touch with them. I hope someday my dream will come true and I will have a perfect holiday.
