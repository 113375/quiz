Travelling becomes more and more popular nowadays. Even ten years ago we couldn’t expect that we would be able to travel almost everywhere. Millions of tourists go to different places during the year.
It is said that travelling broadens your mind and it is absolutely true. Even a short trip where you get to know different people and different cultures may change you completely. It has become a usual thing, for example, for American graduates from school to have so called “gap year” when they don’t go to the university but spend the whole year travelling.
Travelling has become much cheaper now. Thousands of people now decide not to go to the travel agency but to organize the trip by themselves. They book the flight and the hotel, organize the entertainment part and enjoy it. While there are still people who prefer organized expensive voyages, there are people that prefer low-cost travelling. It is the type of travelling when you find the cheapest tickets on the plane, travel with your backpack, stay at the host family and have someone from the local people show you their culture.
For many people travelling becomes the way of living. They spend months and years travelling without coming home and seeing their family. They work, travel and enjoy their lives. And in my opinion it is the most important thing — live and enjoy your life.
