I enjoy eating out. I often have dinner in a good restaurant or café with my friends or my family. I’ve got a couple of favourite places for eating out. One of them is “Tokyo”. It’s a restaurant which offers excellent Japanese cuisine.
The prices aren’t quite low there, the average dinner is about 20-30 dollars for each person. But I prefer high quality and nice service, that’s why I go to “Tokyo“ once or twice a month.
The menu can fit any taste. There is a large selection of vegetarian dishes and special dishes for children which include chicken, steak and pasta meals. There are also a lot of fantastic desserts to choose from. For a starter I normally have some seafood salad, and for the main course it is usually grilled salmon served with wild mushrooms and seasonal vegetables. Sometimes my meal is accompanied by a glass of dry wine. The favourite part of my dinner is the dessert. I am sure that “Tokyo” makes the best chocolate pudding I have ever tasted. So I always order this with a cup of black coffee.
We can have much fun in this restaurant because the food is cooked just in front of us and served by the chefs. We sit around the table for eight people. Our chef brings all ingredients to the table and starts a theatrical performance of preparing the food. The chef chops and grills meat, fish and vegetables. Then he serves our freshly cooked, juicy and steaming hot food. Both adults and children enjoy the show. I really love my evening meals at “Tokyo” restaurant. It offers outstanding food, great service and unforgettable entertainment.
