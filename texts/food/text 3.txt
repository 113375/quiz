Every country has its own culture, traditions, holidays and, of course, cuisine. That makes each nation unique and authentic. Learning about Russian cuisine can help to understand better the nature of the country.
Being the largest country by its area, Russia has a diverse cuisine. From ancient times local people cultivated the land, fished, baked bread, gathered herbs, smoked meat, preserved fruit and vegetables, made wine and kept bee-hives. These traditions are being successfully passed from generation to generation. The best recipes have been recorded in special cook books. Russian food is considered to be diverse, tasteful and healthy. 
Some of my favourite national dishes are borsch, cabbage rolls, pancakes with jam, vinaigrette, kvass and okroshka. Borsch is a beetroot soup, which contains many other vegetables: potatoes, carrots, onions, cabbage. Every housewife has her own recipe of borsch. Cabbage rolls are very tasty. They can be stuffed with meat, rice, herbs and spices.
Russian pancakes are fantastic. They are flat cakes in the shape of sun served with sour cream or cottage cheese. I personally love them with jam or condensed milk.
Vinaigrette is a traditional Russian salad made of cooked beetroot. Other vegetables in it include potatoes, carrots, onion, green peas or beans. People add sauerkraut or pickles to make it more savory.
Kvass is a cold fermented drink made of rye bread. It is especially popular in summertime. It is one of the ingredients of cold Russian soup okroshka. However, some people make okroshka from a fermented milk drink, called kefir.
