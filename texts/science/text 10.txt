Two hundred and fifty years ago, people lived on average for just forty years. Today, in some industrialized parts of the world, the average lifespan has risen to more than eighty years. Better food and hygiene have helped, but one of the main reasons for this change is the advances made in medicine.
Medicine is the branch of science involved with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease and damage to the human body. Medical scientists are constantly searching for new ways of treating diseases. Treatments include drugs, radiation therapy, and surgery. Preventive measures, such as vaccinations against infections, are becoming an increasingly important part of modern medicine.
A doctorâ€™s first step with a sick patient is to diagnose the illness. This can be done in various ways: by asking the patient about his or her symptoms, by making a physical examination of the sick person, and by carrying out medical tests if necessary.
Medical treatments may include drugs or surgery. Surgery is the branch of medicine that involves operating to treat the cause of an illness. Today surgery is so advanced that surgeons can sometimes repair or replace organs such as the kidneys and the heart.
Recovery from an illness or an operation may take only a few hours or as long as several weeks. Much depends on the severity of the illness and the impact the treatment has on the body.
Modern medicine makes use of a wide range of technology. The latest developments include body scanners that use a strong magnetic field or ultrasound to produce an image of the interior of the human body. Such equipment has revolutionized medicine.
